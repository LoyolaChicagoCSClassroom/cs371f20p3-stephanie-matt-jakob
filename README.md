An interpreter of a very simple imperative language implemented as an
F-algebra using
[ScalaÂµ](https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoCode/scalamu). The language
represents the non-OO imperative subset of
[miniool](https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoCode/miniool-scala).

The example illustrates how to deal with failure and delayed,
on-demand evaluation in an F-algebra.
